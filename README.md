<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was a final project for our graphics programming class. The intent was to display proficiency with the OpenGL library with respect to drawing shapes on the screen as well as maintaining game logic. It was decided early in the project that implimenting a 2D drawing system with depth and event handeling would be nessisary to make the project easy to maintain. A depth is applied to all drawable objects and clicking can be added to any object that inherits from the provided clickable class. Along with this text was made easier to display and the default functions for selecing colors were expanded upon.

### Built With

* [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This project requires OpenGL to run. To compile opengl headers must be downloaded and referenced. [Tutorial.](https://www.absingh.com/opengl/)


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Upon starting the game rows and columns of cards will be displayed. Clicking a card will reveal it. The goal is to match each card with the the other card that has the same symbol on it.
